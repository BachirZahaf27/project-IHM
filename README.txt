hi,
1)so i made this project with just the palette of NetBeans ,so when you run it it will appear but that's it .
you can't save (enregistre)
you can't update (modifier)
you can't add another student (ajouter un autre Ã©tudiant)
you can't delete an existing student (supprimer)
2)I just made the window and I need the function to make it work so if you don't know you have to read the project.txt first to understand what the project does and how it works.
3)then after understanding the project you have to know that when you gonna see the project a lot of words is in french like the buttons they are in french and you can't change them to English because I need them in french so I'm really sorry for that this french is my second language  
4)so when i made the window the name of the element are in English so don't worry about that 
5)just one thing is that when you write the code in the function that are premade please make them modifiable so i can change them so french 
thank you so much
